Replicated Arshdeep from yesterday and much worse.  5 wides, one 6, one 4, a wicket and two singles.  4 full tosses.  I think I'll stick to being Digvesh Rathi from Temu. Hide my ball, bowl offspin or carrom balls and rage bait the batters instead. Atleast I'll go less than 10 runs then.", Axar at 3 makes sense to me if the openers bat most of (or all) the PP. He is an elite spin hitter (something which this Indian setup actually lacks) so can be deployed effectively in the middle overs. Throwing him at 3 when a wicket falls in the first over is utter nonsense.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       , "This SKY slump feels so weird. He's been getting starts too but then ends up with something like 11(10). How do you suddenly go from being one of the best T20 batters in the world to being a complete liability in virtually zero time?  Gill looks out of his depth too. I feel like he generally gives himself a couple of overs to get his eye in, but he's been trying to go from ball 1 which he just seems incapable of.  Also, why have they been sending Axar, Hardik, Dube, Samson at 3 on a whim? Like there's no rhyme or reason to it, someone in the dugout just goes ""why not?"". This is not what having a fluid batting order means."

Ponting was right the first time, he's right to double down, and he's right to question whether England has the faith or trust to select Archer to play in Adelaide. Do they honestly think Archer can come back for a 3rd spell in 35 degree temperatures and hit 145+ and take a couple of key wickets? Or, more likely, do they think he'll amble in and stay around 135+ while sulking and looking disinterested in the field?", "I love listening to Ponting talk about cricket, loved watching him play, great guy.  But, I can't ignore this. Does he have multiple copies of his own book on his shelf?"
