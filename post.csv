Why does this happen? Maybe it's genes/sporting culture/varied conditions in Aus (both spinners, fast bowlers flourish)/stronger domestic competition/pragmatic selections (based on performance and not JUST attributes), IDK. Honestly, IDGAF.      Sure, there might be exceptions -- cricketers like Root, Stokes, Anderson etc, the odd Ashes win in Australia (Strauss, Gatting, Brearley etc.), but this will not be the norm. As a neutral, I have accepted it and will only expect a competitive Ashes when Aus visits Eng.",RANDOM CRICKETER OF THE DAY  ASHLEY NOFFKE(AUSTRALIA AND QUEENSLAND)

1pssre9,Test match wins by visiting teams Down Under since 2015,1027,1766385566.0,2025-12-22 12:09:26,NZ is 0 from 6 and England is 0 from 13. This clearly means we're more than twice as good as England when playing in Australia,WI winning before Root has managed a win was just insane to see.,Rahane leading India to a bgt win after the 36 all out along with very inexperienced bowlers was crazy  Can’t forget koach as well in 2019 leading India to a bgt win as well  Shame where India test cricket is right now
1psvv7x,Massive achievement,226,1766397536.0,2025-12-22 15:28:56,"Whats the breakdown format wise? Given the amount of T20 and ODI played these days, how many more (if any) innings of bowling did he have?","Using AI for an infographic you could've found otherwise is so cringe, especially when it gets the stats wrong: Duffy averaged 17.11,",Is this test wickets or an all format record?
1psrl1k,Stuart Broad still believes Australia's Ashes-winning team is their worst side in 15 years,388,1766381457.0,2025-12-22 11:00:57,"I think it is absolutely worth mentioning that the 2017-18 team, on the either side of the 4-0, lost 3-0 in SL, 2-1 in India, tied 1-1 in Ban, 2-1 against SA at home, 3-1 to SA away, 1-0 to Pak in UAE and obviously at home to India 2-1.  Thats a record of 14 losses to 5 victories and 4 draws other than the Ashes.  Conpare that to this team who have lost like 3 games in the last two years for 14 wins.",This team would smash any of Steve Smith’s teams. The bowlers are too good for the batsmen,You got to be smoking some good stuff to think Tim Paines side was better.  Actually it’s by far the best side since 2007 . Most other Aus teams struggled to win matches abroad and especially in Asia  but this team hasn’t lost a series since 2023 and competes much better everywhere.
1psw180,Jhye Richardson closing in on return to Australia's Test squad,142,1766398141.0,2025-12-22 15:39:01,"Nah man, not again. Don't give me hope.  I mean he's class but he's made of glass, I hope he gets a test though.","How is every Australian player in the picture for a game so old? I thought Richardson was like 23 and up and coming, not 29 lmao   But, he will rinse England if he’s fit. He’ll average mid teens with the ball this test",Should play for Cummins
1psx13k,Mentality is reason for England's losing streak in Australia - McGrath,66,1766401905.0,2025-12-22 16:41:45,"He's right. 0-2-16 in your last 4 series in Australia has to be a mental thing. There's been different squads, different play styles, but the same results.","I agree, it's a massive mental block now. Probably the closest tour in terms of pitches/conditions is South Africa, where we've toured four times since 2000 and won 3/drawn 1 series. Against some pretty tasty bowlers, overall team not quite on the level as Australia clearly, but some class sides at points and certainly no excuse to be 0-2-16 since 10/11.","Unless the England players get time to acclimatise to Aussie conditions before the Tests begin,  I think that the England batsmen will continue to have problems competing. We've already witnessed the games getting closer after the 3rd Test, but the series has already been won. A couple of 4 day games against Sheffield shield sides before the Tests  would be better preparation."

1pszagr,Rob Key in a bind as McCullum's wild ride hits Ashes skids,32,1766409313.0,2025-12-22 18:45:13,"The more you read about the coaching setup, the more shocking it sounds.   Carse in 14 tests has worked with 3 fast bowling coaches but there's been a constant spin bowling coach and yet you end up with Jacks as your frontline spinner.   Tres and Baz as batting coaches in a country where they haven't scored runs.   No fielding coach and catches are dropped left and right while the opponents have grabbed pretty much everything that's come their way.",This article from Matt Roller sums it all. Rob Key lives in his own bubble and definitely has his head up his own arse and it shows when he was on Sky comms and now. He and Luke Wright should be the first names on the axe.,"Yeah key has to go.   Make someone who can actually counter baz and stokes decisions rather than not putting any input of his own.  They have taken play work environment to some other level where play has taken a front seat. They don't practice fielding drills as reported.  They don't have a wicketkeeping coach, no fielding coach.   Yeah it's one thing to have too many coaches but I believe the basic coaching position should be filled.  Why are not bowling coaches telling them to hit top of the stump on consistent basis. Who are making these short ball ploys when it's clearly not working?  Some of them needs to be sacked and true working professionals should be instilled.  Even if you bowl poor or bat poor, fielding is one thing that you should be absolutely 100% on."
