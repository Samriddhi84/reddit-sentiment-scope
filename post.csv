Why does this happen? Maybe it's genes/sporting culture/varied conditions in Aus (both spinners, fast bowlers flourish)/stronger domestic competition/pragmatic selections (based on performance and not JUST attributes), IDK. Honestly, IDGAF.      Sure, there might be exceptions -- cricketers like Root, Stokes, Anderson etc, the odd Ashes win in Australia (Strauss, Gatting, Brearley etc.), but this will not be the norm. As a neutral, I have accepted it and will only expect a competitive Ashes when Aus visits Eng.",RANDOM CRICKETER OF THE DAY  ASHLEY NOFFKE(AUSTRALIA AND QUEENSLAND)

1pssre9,Test match wins by visiting teams Down Under since 2015,989,1766385566.0,2025-12-22 12:09:26,NZ is 0 from 6 and England is 0 from 13. This clearly means we're more than twice as good as England when playing in Australia,WI winning before Root has managed a win was just insane to see.,Rahane leading India to a bgt win after the 36 all out along with very inexperienced bowlers was crazy  Can’t forget koach as well in 2019 leading India to a bgt win as well  Shame where India test cricket is right now
1psvv7x,Massive achievement,200,1766397536.0,2025-12-22 15:28:56,"Whats the breakdown format wise? Given the amount of T20 and ODI played these days, how many more (if any) innings of bowling did he have?","Using AI for an infographic you could've found otherwise is so cringe, especially when it gets the stats wrong: Duffy averaged 17.11,",Is this test wickets or an all format record?
1psrl1k,Stuart Broad still believes Australia's Ashes-winning team is their worst side in 15 years,380,1766381457.0,2025-12-22 11:00:57,"I think it is absolutely worth mentioning that the 2017-18 team, on the either side of the 4-0, lost 3-0 in SL, 2-1 in India, tied 1-1 in Ban, 2-1 against SA at home, 3-1 to SA away, 1-0 to Pak in UAE and obviously at home to India 2-1.  Thats a record of 14 losses to 5 victories and 4 draws other than the Ashes.  Conpare that to this team who have lost like 3 games in the last two years for 14 wins.",This team would smash any of Steve Smith’s teams. The bowlers are too good for the batsmen,You got to be smoking some good stuff to think Tim Paines side was better.  Actually it’s by far the best side since 2007 . Most other Aus teams struggled to win matches abroad and especially in Asia  but this team hasn’t lost a series since 2023 and competes much better everywhere.

I mean he's class but he's made of glass, I hope he gets a test though.","How is every Australian player in the picture for a game so old? I thought Richardson was like 23 and up and coming, not 29 lmao   But, he will rinse England if he’s fit. He’ll average mid teens with the ball this test",Should play for Cummins
1psx13k,Mentality is reason for England's losing streak in Australia - McGrath,62,1766401905.0,2025-12-22 16:41:45,"He's right. 0-2-16 in your last 4 series in Australia has to be a mental thing. There's been different squads, different play styles, but the same results.","I agree, it's a massive mental block now. Probably the closest tour in terms of pitches/conditions is South Africa, where we've toured four times since 2000 and won 3/drawn 1 series. Against some pretty tasty bowlers, overall team not quite on the level as Australia clearly, but some class sides at points and certainly no excuse to be 0-2-16 since 10/11.","Unless the England players get time to acclimatise to Aussie conditions before the Tests begin,  I think that the England batsmen will continue to have problems competing. We've already witnessed the games getting closer after the 3rd Test, but the series has already been won. A couple of 4 day games against Sheffield shield sides before the Tests  would be better preparation."
