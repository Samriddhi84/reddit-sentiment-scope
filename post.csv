I don't want to remember anything about this day. Ughhhhh  Today is my father's death anniversary, I don't know what to do, I don't want to cry, I don't want to call my mom, my brother or even my friends. I just want to distract myself the whole day, is there anything that will keep me busy the whole day?? I don't want to be sad.","Just had the most ridiculous test match I’ve ever played in Cricket 22.  Made my test debut finally against Afghanistan, set them 459 to win. We had them at 6-97, then their number 8 comes in and makes 75. Their number 9 comes in and makes 167 not out. Their number 10 only makes 29 and they’re now 9/331. Their number 11 comes in and makes 54 not out and they chase down 459 at 5:33pm on day 5 and win by one wicket. Utter madness","Why is the discussion on so many subs, especially the Indian ones, dominated by relationship related stuff?"

Terrible to bat on, but it didn’t have full balls going over the shoulder.   Also the ICC probably isn’t going to ever cause any major stadium to actually lose a test.",That curator should be forced to spend the remaining 3 days locked in a room with Marnus as punishment.
